# Experiments

This repo should serve as a container for various bits of code that are used in testing/prototyping. Since 2020, [we're trying to better document all experiments](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/hyped-2020/wiki/Knowledge-Base-Home) and preserving any supporting code is part of it. Hopefully, this will make experiments much easier to repeat in the future.
